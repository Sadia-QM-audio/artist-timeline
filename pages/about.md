This website is a student project. It uses the open access APIs of [The Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/) and the [Cleveland Museum of Art](https://www.clevelandart.org/). The APIs are used to collect information about the works by a particular artist, and create a timeline.

This website uses the theme [Millenial](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Millennial) by [Paul Le](https://www.lenpaul.com/). This theme is open source software, and is distributed under the [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). 

The timeline uses html and css from this [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp).
